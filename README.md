# Java Design Patterns Exercises

This repository contains exercises on Java design patterns, focusing on the Singleton and Abstract Factory patterns. Each exercise is structured with a `Main` class to demonstrate the usage of the pattern.

## 🎯 Level 1: Singleton Pattern

### 📝 Description
The goal of this exercise is to implement a Singleton pattern in a class that mimics the functionality of the 'Undo' command. The `Undo` class should store the latest commands entered by the user and provide functionality to add, remove, and list these commands.

## 🎯 Abstract Factory Pattern

### 📝 Description
The **Abstract Factory** pattern is used to create families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes. In this exercise, the pattern is applied to manage international addresses and phone numbers, ensuring that the correct formats are used for different countries.

### 🚀 How to Run
1. Navigate to the `abstract-factory` directory.
2. Compile and run the `Main` class:
   ```bash
   javac src/Main.java
   java src/Main
